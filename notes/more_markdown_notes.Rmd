YAML Header, has to stay here
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
# shows the code as well as the results, echo = FALSE if giving report to superior
# warning = false so warnings aren't shown in the doc
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

**bold**

*italic*

```{r cars, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3 , fig.width=3, fig.align='center'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
